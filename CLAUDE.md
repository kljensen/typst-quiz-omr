# Typst quiz OMR

This repo has [Typst](https://typst.app/) code for
1-page quizzes in my class as well as python code
for grading quizzes. The python code uses OpenCV
and other tricks for OMR of documents scanned and
made into PDFs. There are extremely comprehensive
tests and all the python code is typed (mypy).
It uses modern best practices including mypy,
dataclasses, pytest, etc.
